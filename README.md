# 2017 SURF Program at LIGO Laboratory

Welcome to the 2017 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program at LIGO Lab!

LIGO, short for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, is a network of two U.S.-based observatories in [Hanford, WA](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/WA/) and [Livingston, LA.](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/LA/) The LIGO detectors search for gravitational waves emanating from the cosmos between 30 and 2000 Hz, which come from sources such as binary black hole mergers. These are the "brightest" known explosions in the universe -- except for the fact that they don't emit any light!

Three binary black hole merger signals have been observed to date:
* [GW150914](https://losc.ligo.org/events/GW150914/): Our first detection in September 2015, which caught everyone by surprise
* [GW151226](https://losc.ligo.org/events/GW151226/): Our second detection, which came on my birthday in 2015!
* [GW170104](https://losc.ligo.org/events/GW170104/): Our most recent detection, from January 2017

This is a repository containing astrophysics and data analysis tutorials for incoming students in the program. Below you will find instructions for access, as well as an outline of the repo's contents. There is also a summary of helpful links provided toward the end.

Pro tip: if your eyes hurt after staring at a computer screen all day, consider using software that adjusts your monitor's color filter to reflect indoor vs. outdoor lighting conditions, such as [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com).
