# 2017 SURF Program at LIGO Laboratory

Welcome to the 2017 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program at LIGO Lab!

LIGO, short for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, is a network of two U.S.-based observatories in [Hanford, WA](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/WA/) and [Livingston, LA](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/LA/). The LIGO detectors search for gravitational waves emanating from the cosmos between roughly 20 and 2000 Hz, which come from sources such as binary black hole mergers. These are the "brightest" known explosions in the universe -- except for the fact that they don't emit any light!

Three binary black hole merger signals have been observed to date:
* [GW150914](https://losc.ligo.org/events/GW150914/): Our first detection in September 2015, which caught everyone by surprise
* [GW151226](https://losc.ligo.org/events/GW151226/): Our second detection, with smaller component masses
* [GW170104](https://losc.ligo.org/events/GW170104/): Our most recent detection, from January 2017

A weak but statistically significant binary black hole signal called [LVT151012](https://losc.ligo.org/events/LVT151012) was also observed during the first observing run.

This repository contains material related to astrophysics and data analysis lectures for incoming LIGO SURF students. Below you will find instructions for access, as well as an outline of the repo's contents. Lastly, there is also a summary of helpful links provided toward the end.

Pro tip: if your eyes hurt after staring at a computer screen all day, consider using software that adjusts your monitor's color filter to reflect indoor vs. outdoor and night vs. day lighting conditions, such as [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com).
